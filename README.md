# Smart-lock-with-OTP-authentication
A smart lock system using Arduino that generates a 4-character OTP and sends it via SMS using the SIM800A GSM module. The user enters the OTP on a 4x4 keypad. If correct, a servo motor unlocks the lock. An I2C LCD displays system messages. This project enhances security with mobile-based authentication.
